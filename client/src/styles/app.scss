 *
 * base/
 *    Base rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element
 *    selectors but it could include attribute selectors, pseudo-class
 *    selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors. Essentially, a base
 *    style says that wherever this element is on the page, it should look
 *    like _this_.
 *
 * layout/
 *    Layout rules divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or
 *    more components together.
 *
 * component/
 *    Component rules are specific to individual atomic pieces that comprise
 *    layout sections
